We are interested seeing what are the top tags used in posts.

Write a mapreduce program that would output Top 10 tags, ordered by the number of questions they appear in.

For an extra challenge you can think about how to get a top 10 list of tags, where they are ordered by some weighted score of your choice. If you decide to do this, then please submit your solution to the regular problem and then also submit this extra challenge problem in separate files as described on the instruction page.
